# Prework Study Guide
Prework study details for the bootcamp

## Description
This is the **pre work** for the front end bootcamp, it involved basic html, css and javascript.
It took quite a while, but wasn't too hard and was ok to complete.
I have enjoyed it and look forward to moving on through much more education

## Motivation?
Love to code and want to get back into tech.

## Table of Contents
There is a little info on all of the topics covered in the pre work section on this page - all contained withing the index.html, style.cc and script.js files.
